 Exploring CNNs as Feature Extractors .This repository demonstrates how to use pre-trained models (ResNet-50, VGG-16, VGG-19, InceptionNetv3) to extract and visualize features from images in the Stanford Car Dataset using TensorFlow Keras. Includes assignment details and Jupyter notebook implementation.
